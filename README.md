# Predictive Modeling Analysis - HW1 Problem 5

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for Problem 5 of Homework 1, focusing on predictive modeling using various techniques such as Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to explore the performance of these models on a specific dataset, experimenting with different hyper-parameter values to gauge model effectiveness.

## Predictive Modeling Process
The analysis involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
2. **Model Training**: Implementing Decision Tree, k-NN, Logistic Regression, and SVM models using a range of hyper-parameter values.
3. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance through metrics such as confusion matrix, predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure.

## Explorations and Results
Each model's performance is evaluated, and the results are compared to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each technique in the context of the given dataset. Hyper-parameter tuning is conducted to find optimal settings for each model.

## Model Goodness
Model effectiveness is quantified using several metrics:
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a detailed breakdown of prediction outcomes.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Measures the overall accuracy of the model.
- **Precision & Recall**: Evaluate the model's ability to identify relevant instances.
- **F-Measure**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric to assess model performance.

## ROC and Lift Curves
The analysis also includes a discussion on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and lift curves, essential tools for evaluating classifier performance and decision-making thresholds.

## Usage
Instructions on how to set up the environment, run the analysis, and interpret the results are provided.
